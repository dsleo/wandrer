Just like [Wandrer](https://wandrer.earth), the goal is to determine whether any segments within a newly Strava activity have been ridden or run before.  

To accomplish this, we employ two distinct strategies:

* Geometrical Approach: By examining the geographical relationship between historical and new activity path segments, we get previously untraveled routes.

* Lexical Approach: We simply compare the historical and new activity Strava segment names. It's that easy.
